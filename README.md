This project was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and packages: react-router-dom, and mobx and mobx-react using decorators.

##  Install

`npm install`

## Run project

`npm start`

Open in browser: http://localhost:3000/

## Notes on setup:
I first ejected react project so i could configure babel to transpile MobX decorators.
Then, I configured babel in package.json to enable decorator transpiling.
And finally I installed packages mobx and mobx-react.
